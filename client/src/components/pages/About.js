            I am Keonnia Huff 24 years old. Born and raised in Riverdale Georgia, Clayco, I Went to Miles college and got a degree in Biology in 2019. I never really thought about what I wanted to do and what really made me happy until 2021. Which was Gaming! So DeadRhose Games was invented. The name came from me always dying in a game mixed in with my sorority spelling Rho! I am apart of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc. My ultimate goal is to turn DeadRhose Games into a business! Other than gaming my hobbies are swimming, singing, and dancing. I am a bubble person with the personality to match. I Loveee Food and sleeping on my down time.
